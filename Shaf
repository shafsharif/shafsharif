- 👋 Hi, I’m @shafsharif 
- 👀 I’m interested in the natural environment. Particularly, I am interested in the hydrologic cycle and how to protect it from anthropogenic activites. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning meteorology, aiming to become a hydro-meteorologist in the future. I am part of an EPA project which aims to study Atmospheric river events over Ireland. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to do with hydrology, hydrogeology, climate adaptation, nature-based solutions etc.
- 📫 You can reach me on shafsharif92@gmail.com (personal) or ssharif@tcd.ie (work).
